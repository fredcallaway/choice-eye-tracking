Attention allocation in decision making as optimal sequential sampling.

People often have to make choices based on partial and error-prone evaluations of the available options. Accumulator models, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM), well predict both the reaction times and choices people make in such decisions, and a recent extension of the DDM additionally explains how such choices are affected by visual attention. However, as of yet, there is no model of how people choose which option to attend to at each moment. I propose that people rationally allocate their attention in order to maximize expected decision quality minus attentional costs. To formalize this theory, I present a Bayesian sequential sampling model as an alternative to the classical DDM (which is not provably optimal for non-binary choice). This results in a _metalevel Markov decision process_, the optimal policy of which can be approximated by reinforcement learning. We find that the rational model predicts key qualitative trends in human attention allocation as measured by eye-tracking.
