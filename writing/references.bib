@article{russell91,
	Abstract = {In this paper we outline a general approach to the study of metareasoning, not in the sense of explicating the semantics of explicitly specified meta-level control policies, but in the sense of providing a basis for selecting and justifying computational actions. This research contributes to a developing attack on the problem of resource-bounded rationality, by providing a means for analyzing and generating optimal computational strategies. Because reasoning about a computation without doing it necessarily involves uncertainty as to its outcome, probability and decision theory will be our main tools. We develop a general formula for the utility of computations, this utility being derived directly from the ability of computations to affect an agent's external actions. We address some philosophical difficulties that arise in specifying this formula, given our assumption of limited rationality. We also describe a methodology for applying the theory to particular problem-solving systems, and provide a brief sketch of the resulting algorithms and their performance. ?? 1991.},

	Abstract = {An important open problem is how values are compared to make simple choices. A natural hypothesis is that the brain carries out the computations associated with the value comparisons in a manner consistent with the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), since this model has been able to account for a large amount of data in other domains. We investigated the ability of four different versions of the DDM to explain the data in a real binary food choice task under conditions of high and low time pressure. We found that a seven-parameter version of the DDM can account for the choice and reaction time data with high-accuracy, in both the high and low time pressure conditions. The changes associated with the introduction of time pressure could be traced to changes in two key model parameters: the barrier height and the noise in the slope of the drift process.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews studies on eye movements in decision making, and compares their observations to theoretical predictions concerning the role of attention in decision making. Four decision theories are examined: rational models, bounded rationality, evidence accumulation, and parallel constraint satisfaction models. Although most theories were confirmed with regard to certain predictions, none of the theories adequately accounted for the role of attention during decision making. Several observations emerged concerning the drivers and down-stream effects of attention on choice, suggesting that attention processes plays an active role in constructing decisions. So far, decision theories have largely ignored the constructive role of attention by assuming that it is entirely determined by heuristics, or that it consists of stochastic information sampling. The empirical observations reveal that these assumptions are implausible, and that more accurate assumptions could have been made based on prior attention and eye movement research. Future decision making research would benefit from greater integration with attention research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{sanborn16,
	Abstract = {Bayesian explanations have swept through cognitive science over the past two decades, from intuitive physics and causal learning, to perception, motor con-trol and language. Yet people flounder with even the simplest probability questions. What explains this apparent paradox? How can a supposedly Bayes-ian brain reason so poorly with probabilities? In this paper, we propose a direct and perhaps unexpected answer: that Bayesian brains need not represent or calculate probabilities at all and are, indeed, poorly adapted to do so. Instead, the brain is a Bayesian sampler. Only with infinite samples does a Bayesian sampler conform to the laws of probability; with finite samples it systematically generates classic probabilistic reasoning errors, including the unpacking effect, base-rate neglect, and the conjunction fallacy. Bayesian Brains without Probabilities In an uncertain world it is not easy to know what to do or what to believe. The Bayesian approach gives a formal framework for finding the best action despite that uncertainty, by assigning each possible state of the world a probability, and using the laws of probability to calculate the best action. Bayesian cognitive science has successfully modelled behavior in complex domains, whether in vision, motor control, language, categorization or common-sense reasoning, in terms of highly complex probabilistic models [1--13]. Yet in many simple domains, people make systematic probability reasoning errors, which have been argued to undercut the Bayesian approach [14--17]. In this paper, we argue for the opposite view: that the brain implements Bayesian inference and that systematic probability reasoning errors actually follow from a Bayesian approach. We stress that a Bayesian cognitive model does not require that the brain calculates or even represents probabilities. Instead, the key assumption is that the brain is a Bayesian sampler (see Glossary). While the idea that cognition is implemented by Bayesian samplers is not new [18--27], here we show that any Bayesian sampler is faced with two challenges that automatically generate classic probabilistic reasoning errors, and only converge on 'well-behaved' probabilities at an (unattainable) limit of an infinite number of samples. In short, here we make the argument that Bayesian cognitive models that operate well in complex domains actually predict probabilistic reasoning errors in simple domains (see Table 1, Key Table). To see why, we begin with the well-known theoretical argument against the na{\{}{\"{i}}{\}}ve conception that a Bayesian brain must represent all possible probabilities and make exact calculations using these probabilities: that such calculations are too complex for any physical system, including brains, to perform in even moderately complex domains [4,28--30]. A crude indication of this is that the number of real numbers required to encode the joint probability distribution over n binary variables grows exponentially with 2 n , quickly exceeding the capacity of any imaginable physical},

	Abstract = {How do we make decisions when confronted with several alternatives (e.g., on a supermarket shelf)? Previous work has shown that accumulator models, such as the drift-diffusion model, can provide accurate descriptions of the psychometric data for binary value-based choices, and that the choice process is guided by visual attention. However, the computational processes used to make choices in more complicated situations involving three or more options are unknown. We propose a model of trinary value-based choice that generalizes what is known about binary choice, and test it using an eye-tracking experiment. We find that the model provides a quantitatively accurate description of the relationship between choice, reaction time, and visual fixation data using the same parameters that were estimated in previous work on binary choice. Our findings suggest that the brain uses similar computational processes to make binary and trinary choices.},

	Abstract = {Behavioral data obtained with perceptual decision making experiments are typically analyzed with the drift-diffusion model. This parsimonious model accumulates noisy pieces of evidence toward a decision bound to explain the accuracy and reaction times of subjects. Recently, Bayesian models have been proposed to explain how the brain extracts information from noisy input as typically presented in perceptual decision making tasks. It has long been known that the drift-diffusion model is tightly linked with such functional Bayesian models but the precise relationship of the two mechanisms was never made explicit. Using a Bayesian model, we derived the equations which relate parameter values between these models. In practice we show that this equivalence is useful when fitting multi-subject data. We further show that the Bayesian model suggests different decision variables which all predict equal responses and discuss how these may be discriminated based on neural correlates of accumulated evidence. In addition, we discuss extensions to the Bayesian model which would be difficult to derive for the drift-diffusion model. We suggest that these and other extensions may be highly useful for deriving new experiments which test novel hypotheses.},

In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low prob- abilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},
